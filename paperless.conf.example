# After a document is consumed, Paperless can trigger an arbitrary script if
# you like.  This script will be passed a number of arguments for you to work
# with.  The default is blank, which means nothing will be executed.  For more

# By default, paperless will check the document text for document date information.
# Uncomment the line below to enable checking the document filename for date
# information. The date order can be set to any option as specified in
# https://dateparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#settings. The filename will be
# checked first, and if nothing is found, the document text will be checked
# as normal.
#PAPERLESS_FILENAME_DATE_ORDER="YMD"

# Sometimes devices won't create filenames which can be parsed properly
# by the filename parser (see

#
# This setting allows to specify a list of transformations
# in regular expression syntax, which are passed in order to re.sub.
# Transformation stops after the first match, so at most one transformation
# is applied.
#
# Syntax is a JSON array of dictionaries containing "pattern" and "repl"
# as keys.
#
# The example below transforms filenames created by a Brother ADS-2400N
# document scanner in its standard configuration `Name_Date_Count', so that

#
# The following values use sensible defaults for modern systems, but if you're
# running Paperless on a low-resource device (like a Raspberry Pi), modifying
# some of these values may be necessary.
#


# By default, Paperless will attempt to use all available CPU cores to process
# a document, but if you would like to limit that, you can set this value to
# an integer:
#PAPERLESS_OCR_THREADS=1


# Customize the default language that tesseract will attempt to use when
# parsing documents.  It should be a 3-letter language code consistent with ISO
# 639: https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php
#PAPERLESS_OCR_LANGUAGE=eng


# On smaller systems, or even in the case of Very Large Documents, the consumer
# may explode, complaining about how it's "unable to extend pixel cache".  In
# such cases, try setting this to a reasonably low value, like 32000000.  The
# default is to use whatever is necessary to do everything without writing to
# disk, and units are in megabytes.
#
# For more information on how to use this value, you should probably search
# the web for "MAGICK_MEMORY_LIMIT".
#PAPERLESS_CONVERT_MEMORY_LIMIT=0


# Similar to the memory limit, if you've got a small system and your OS mounts
# /tmp as tmpfs, you should set this to a path that's on a physical disk, like
# /home/your_user/tmp or something.  ImageMagick will use this as scratch space
# when crunching through very large documents.
#
# For more information on how to use this value, you should probably search
# the web for "MAGICK_TMPDIR".
#PAPERLESS_CONVERT_TMPDIR=/var/tmp/paperless


# By default the conversion density setting for documents is 300DPI, in some
# cases it has proven useful to configure a lesser value.
# This setting has a high impact on the physical size of tmp page files,
# the speed of document conversion, and can affect the accuracy of OCR
# results. Individual results can vary and this setting should be tested
# thoroughly against the documents you are importing to see if it has any
# impacts either negative or positive.
# Testing on limited document sets has shown a setting of 200 can cut the
# size of tmp files by 1/3, and speed up conversion by up to 4x
# with little impact to OCR accuracy.
#PAPERLESS_CONVERT_DENSITY=300


# (This setting is ignored on Linux where inotify is used instead of a
# polling loop.)
# The number of seconds that Paperless will wait between checking
# PAPERLESS_CONSUMPTION_DIR.  If you tend to write documents to this directory
# rarely, you may want to use a higher value than the default (10).
#PAPERLESS_CONSUMER_LOOP_TIME=10


# By default Paperless stops consuming a document if no language can be
# detected. Set to true to consume documents even if the language detection
# fails.
#PAPERLESS_FORGIVING_OCR="false"


# By default Paperless does not OCR a document if the text can be retrieved from
# the document directly. Set to true to always OCR documents.
#PAPERLESS_OCR_ALWAYS="false"
