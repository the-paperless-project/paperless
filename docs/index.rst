Paperless
=========

Paperless is a simple Django application running in two parts:
a :ref:`consumer <utilities-consumer>` (the thing that does the indexing) and
the :ref:`webserver <utilities-webserver>` (the part that lets you search &
download already-indexed documents). If you want to learn more about its
functions keep on reading after the installation section.

Why This Exists
===============

Paper is a nightmare.  Environmental issues aside, there's no excuse for it in
the 21st century.  It takes up space, collects dust, doesn't support any form
of a search feature, indexing is tedious, it's heavy and prone to damage &
loss.

I wrote this to make "going paperless" easier.  I do not have to worry about
finding stuff again. I feed documents right from the post box into the scanner
and then shred them.  Perhaps you might find it useful too.
